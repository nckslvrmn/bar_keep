## üê≥ Docker Setup

BarKeep is designed to run in Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nckslvrmn/bar_keep.git
   cd bar_keep
   ```

2. **Build the container**
   ```bash
   docker build -t bar_keep .
   ```

3. **Generate a secret key** (Required!)
   ```bash
   # Now that the container is built, generate a secret key
   docker run --rm bar_keep:latest rails secret
   ```

   **Copy this key - you'll need it for the next step. Keep it safe and never commit it to version control!**

4. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   # Run the container with persistent storage and your secret key
   docker run -d \
     --name barkeep \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     -v $(pwd)/storage:/app/storage \
     -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY_HERE \
     -e ALLOWED_HOST=barkeep.yourdomain.com  # Set to your custom domain \
     -e FORCE_SSL=false \
     bar_keep:latest
   ```

   > **Note**: The database will be automatically created, migrated, and seeded on first run!
   >
   > **For production deployments**: Remove `-e FORCE_SSL=false` to enable SSL security unless behind a proxy

5. **Access the application**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Follow steps 1-3 in the Quick Start section and then:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       volumes:
         - ./storage:/app/storage
       environment:
         - RAILS_ENV=production
         - SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY_HERE  # Required!
         - ALLOWED_HOST=barkeep.yourdomain.com  # Set to your custom domain
         - FORCE_SSL=false  # leave as false if hosted behind proxy
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## üìÅ Data Persistence

All application data is stored in the `storage` directory:
- **SQLite databases** - All environments (development, production, test)
- **Uploaded images** - Product images via ActiveStorage
- **User sessions** - Authentication data

When replacing or updating containers, ensure you mount the same storage volume to maintain your data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

If you want to run BarKeep without Docker for development:

### Requirements

- Ruby 3.4.0
- Bundler
- SQLite3

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Set up the database
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed  # Creates sample data

# Start the server
rails server
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - **Required!** Generate with `docker run --rm bar_keep:latest rails secret`
- `RAILS_ENV` - Set to `production` for production deployments (default: production)
- `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` - Number of threads (default: 5)
- `FORCE_SSL` - Set to `false` to disable SSL for local testing or if hosting behind proxy
- `ALLOWED_HOST` - Hostname to accept requests from (default: localhost). Set to your domain in production
- `SEED_DATABASE` - Set to "true" to seed the database in production (optional)

### Host Configuration

By default, Rails accepts requests from localhost (including 127.0.0.1 and ::1) in production mode. Rails uses a security feature that blocks requests from unknown hosts to prevent DNS rebinding attacks.

The `ALLOWED_HOST` environment variable tells Rails which additional hostname to accept requests from. You'll need to set this when:

- Running behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.)
- Using a custom domain or subdomain
- Accessing the application from a non-localhost address
- Testing with tools like ngrok during development

For example, if your BarKeep instance is accessible at `barkeep.yourdomain.com`, you would set `ALLOWED_HOST=barkeep.yourdomain.com`. If you're using a reverse proxy, make sure the host matches what the proxy forwards.

### Database

BarKeep uses SQLite by default with databases stored in the `storage` directory:
- Development: `storage/development.sqlite3`
- Production: `storage/production.sqlite3`
- Test: `storage/test.sqlite3`

## üì± Usage

### Default Credentials

If you ran the seed command, you can log in with:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `changeme123`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please change the password after first login!**

### Key Features

1. **Adding Items**: Click "Add New Item" to add beverages and supplies
2. **Managing Stock**: Use the +/- buttons to quickly adjust quantities
3. **Restocking**: Visit `/items/restocking` to see what needs ordering
4. **Categories**: Create categories like "Spirits", "Beer", "Wine", "Mixers"
5. **Filtering**: Use the sidebar filters to find items quickly

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployments:

1. **Use the secret key** you generated earlier (see the [Generate a Secret Key](#-generate-a-secret-key-required) section)
2. Ensure the storage volume is backed up regularly
3. Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) for SSL
4. Monitor your logs: `docker logs -f barkeep`

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
